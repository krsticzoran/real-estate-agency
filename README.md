Welcome to the Real Estate Agency App, a showcase of my frontend development skills using technologies like React, TypeScript, and GraphQL. This project demonstrates my expertise in creating a dynamic and visually engaging website.
<br /><br />
This website contains all the functionalities that a real estate agency website should have. Properties are categorized, and you can also search them based on specific characteristics. Additionally, the website includes many other features, along with a dashboard accessed by clicking the login button, which allows you to add or delete a property.
